Project Summary:
Web3EasyAccess: Provides an easy way to access the web3 world. People can log in to this website just like a regular Web2 website and then manage decentralized assets and explore the decentralized world.
We utilize EIP712 to implement this system. Through the services provided by this system, users do not need to manage mnemonic phrases or private keys, but instead control their accounts using their own passwords, while still retaining the key features of "decentralization". Additionally, users can modify their existing password information while keeping their account addresses unchanged.

Team Description:
As a solo developer with extensive experience in both front-end and back-end development, as well as a solid grasp of EVM smart contract development, I'm fully committed to the long-term development of "Web3EasyAccess".  My Twitter: @zhtkeepup ;  My Email: zhtkeepup@gmail.com

What makes your project unique compared to your competitors out there? What is novel about your approach?:
Leveraging EIP-712, we propose an innovative approach to account abstraction, offering a new and convenient way for ordinary users to access Web3.

How will your project benefit the broader Scroll ecosystem?*
:
As a convenient entry point to Web3, it will significantly attract both new and existing Web3 users, providing easy access to other dApps in the Scroll ecosystem and thereby increasing TVL on the Scroll chain.


What are you hoping to accomplish with this grant? :
web3easyaccess is a project that I am deeply invested in. I will be dedicating all my time and effort to its development and refinement. The platform currently supports transaction query, password reset, ETH transfers, and interactive reward distribution. Here's our next plan:


-   2024Q3:

1. Enhancing gas fee estimation for layer2 transactions;
2. Implementing ERC20 and ERC721 token transfers;
3. Implementing asset bridging between Scroll and the Ethereum mainnet;
4. Conducting performance benchmarks, optimizations, and hardware upgrades;
5. Refining the interactive reward mechanism;
6. User testing on the Scroll testnet;
7. launch on Scroll mainnet(formal network);
8. Small scale promotion, the target is the number of transaction addresses on the chain is not less than 100.

-   2024Q4:

9. Synchronizing password changes across Scroll and the Ethereum mainnet;
10. Providing customizable transaction parameters;
11. Integrating with the top 3 DEXs on Scroll;
12. further promote, the goal is to have no less than 1000 transaction addresses on the chain..

-   2025Q1:

13. Introducing account guardianship features;
14. Enabling autonomous upgrades for account functions;
15. Adopting USD-based asset pricing;
16. Supporting batch transactions.
17. Connect to at least one other hot dapp
18. Continuous promotion, with the goal of no less than 3000 transaction addresses on the chain.

-   2025Q2:

19. Connect to more DApps
20. Continuous promotion, with the goal of no less than 10000 transaction addresses on the chain.

Risks and Challenges
*:
1. Compared to ordinary wallets, we can't quickly connect to any dapp


Budget Breakdown:
Our team will invite other development partners and marketing partners to join as appropriate, and the funds will be used for the salaries of the team members. More importantly, for the smooth operation and expansion of the system server, we will also invest corresponding funds. In addition, we will also invest in marketing


More Support
:
When we need to connect with other Dapps, if we can get your communication assistance, we will increase the probability of successful connection
